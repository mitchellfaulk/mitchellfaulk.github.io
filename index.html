      <div class="about">
        <p>Hello! And welcome to my personal page.</p>
	<p>I'm trained as a mathematician, with a PhD from Columbia University 
		and a BS from the University of Notre Dame. After my studies, 
		I completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Vanderbilt University,
		where I continued to research problems in geometry that 
		are motivated, in part, by equations due to Einstein describing
		the shape of the universe. </p>
	<p>In that time, I've also taught and mentored hundreds of students on 
	      a variety of topics in mathematics, including, but not limited to,
	      real analysis, convex optimization, linear algebra, differential 
	      equations, and multivariable Calculus.</p>
	<p>Recently I've been teaching myself computer sciece and data science, 
	      and I've shared some updates on my personal <a href="https://mitchellmfaulk.wordpress.com/">blog</a>. 
	      You can also find some of my recent projects displayed below.</p>

        <h3>SET game simulator +</h3>
        <p>A collection of python scripts to simulate the card game SET 
	      in order to study statistics from the game (and refute some 
	      statistics listed in the game's instruction manual). </p>
	<p>The scripts also permit simulations of other analogous 'games'
	      that could be played in other dimensions.</p>
