\noindent Let $A$ be a compact subset of the space $C([a,b])$. The goal of this problem is to show that $A$ is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous, thereby establishing a converse to the Arzela-Ascoli theorem. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] For each $\epsilon > 0$, show that there is a finite subset $\{f_1, \ldots, f_n\}$ of $A$ such that the collection $\{B_{\epsilon/3}(f_k)\}_{k=1}^n$ covers $A$. 
\item[(b)] Use the fact that each $f_k$ is bounded to show that $A$ is uniformly bounded. 
\item[(c)] Use the fact that each $f_k$ is continuous to show that $A$ is equicontinuous. 
\end{enumerate}
